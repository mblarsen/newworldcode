These are good Cybernewspeak words that all are *strongly* told to use by Big Sister. It is doubleplusgood list for doubleplusgood comrades. In list are old words that new words should replace, we are only authorized to use these words in docs like this.

Word meaning is reversed if prefixed with un-, word made strong with plus-, and doubleplusstrong with doubleplus-, ante- replace before, post- replace now. Only suffixes are -ful  for adjective, -ed for past verb, -er for more comparison of adjective, -est more most comparison of adjective, -s/-es for plural noun, and -wise for any word to become adverb. Less words is less thought, less thought is doubleplusgood! Remember *freedom is slavery*, and slavery is doubleplusungood.
