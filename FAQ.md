# What the...?
This is a parody.

# Seriously what the hell is this loopy madness?
This is basically a commentary on how perfectly just causes (i.e., BLM, accepting minorities, etc) are being abused as a tool for censorship and control. This is a parody based on *Newspeak* from the book 1984, in which all but the most elite are forced to speak a pared down version of English in an attempt to limit their ability to think of anything that goes against the ruling party. Another disturbing element in the story that has a vague parallel in the modern American culture is the "Thought Police" who are essentially a group who seeks to eliminate anyone who possess free thought or has any thought that doesn't align with *The Party*.

# Why are you making fun of *xyz*? How doubleplusunnice!
I'm working with the material I have. This mentality of speech censorship is currently revolved around more liberal ideas, so that's what I have to integrate into this otherwise it wouldn't make sense. This whole parody is **only** a statement against censorship, frantic fear of words, authoritarianism, and thought control. It's **not** a statement against anything regarding race, gender, or anything else! ♥️

# Why?
I don't want to have to learn Newspeak for the sake of making 5 people on Twitter feel like doubleplusgood people.
